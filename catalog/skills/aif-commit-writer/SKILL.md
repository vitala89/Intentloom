# aif-commit-writer

## Trigger

Use only when the request matches this skill's stated purpose and has staged diff summary. Do not trigger to stage, commit, or push.

## Inputs

- staged diff summary
- Any explicitly relevant canonical policy or workflow.

## Procedure

1. Read only the smallest relevant canonical sources.
2. Perform the bounded task directly; do not spawn subagents for this bounded work.
3. Keep stack-specific assumptions out of the result.

## Exact outputs

Return one conventional commit subject and optional body.

## Stop conditions

Stop when the output is complete, a required input is absent, or a decision outside the request is needed. State the blocker rather than guessing.
