# aif-task-router

## Trigger

Use before a non-trivial feature, defect, architecture, adoption, external
extension, or multi-step task when the route is not explicit. Do not trigger for
an isolated answer or an obvious bounded edit with stated checks.

## Inputs

- user intent and requested outcome
- project-owned instructions, current state, specifications, and ADRs
- capability, approval, risk, and validation constraints

## Procedure

1. Read the relevant project-owned guidance before selecting a procedure.
2. Classify the route as `direct`, `clarify`, `discover`, `diagnose`, `plan`,
   `implement`, `review`, or `adopt`.
3. Select the smallest relevant skills and explain each selection. Recommend
   feature discovery only when ambiguity, alternatives, or risk justify the
   additional user interaction.
4. Add security, privacy, architecture, or extension review when the affected
   boundary requires it. Always include fresh verification before completion.
5. Treat skills as guidance only. Never expand filesystem, network, process,
   credential, publication, or delegation authority.

## Exact outputs

Return the selected route, recommended skills, reasons, required approvals,
expected checks, and the first safe action.

## Stop conditions

Stop after one bounded route is selected, or when a material product decision
requires user input. Do not begin implementation from an unapproved discovery
result.

## Related

This skill selects _which route and skills_ a request needs. It does not set
model, reasoning effort, subagent plan, or token budget for the coding agent
carrying out the work - see `docs/governance/AGENT_TASK_TRIAGE_POLICY.md` for
that axis.
