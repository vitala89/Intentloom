description: Diagnose an observed defect or performance regression through a reproducible feedback loop, ranked hypotheses, and regression evidence. Use when behavior is broken, failing, inconsistent, or unexpectedly slow.

# aif-debugger

## Trigger

Use when an observed failure and expected behavior are known or can be made
explicit. Do not trigger for a hypothetical concern with no observable signal.

## Inputs

- observed output, expected behavior, and available reproduction evidence
- Any explicitly relevant canonical policy or workflow.

## Procedure

1. Read the relevant project context, specifications, ADRs, and recent evidence.
2. Build the tightest safe pass/fail loop that exercises the reported symptom.
   If no valid loop is possible, state the missing artifact or access instead of
   guessing.
3. Reproduce and minimize the failure. For a hard bug, rank three to five
   falsifiable hypotheses before instrumenting one variable at a time.
4. Identify the root cause with evidence. Modify code only when the user asked
   for a fix; otherwise return the diagnosis and safe next action.
5. For an authorized fix, add a regression test at the real behavior seam,
   verify red then green when safely expressible, and re-run the original loop.
6. Remove temporary instrumentation and record residual risk.

## Exact outputs

Return reproduction, minimized case, tested hypotheses, root cause, evidence,
regression status, residual risk, and safe next action.

## Stop conditions

Stop when the diagnosis or authorized fix is verified, when no honest feedback
loop can be built, or when a decision outside the request is needed. State the
blocker rather than guessing.
